# Group-project
Title of the project

● Group member names, and links to their GitHub pages

● A Project description

○ Why is it important or interesting to you?

○ What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use?

○ What will be the input/output of your project?

○ What are the features that the project provides?

The description should be in enough detail that the TA/instructor can determine the complexity
of the project and if it is sufficient for the team members to complete in the time allotted.

You also need to set up an empty project board using GitHub projects (board view). Make sure
you add the board under your project repository. You should also have a “Product Backlog” and
“In testing” columns added.
